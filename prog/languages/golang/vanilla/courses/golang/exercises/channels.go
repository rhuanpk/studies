//go:build channels

/*
	Create some program that:
		- what is concurrency?
			R: concurrency, do lots of things at once. Thatâ€™s different from doing lots of things at the same time Channels.
		- when do you need channels?
			R: to communicate between goroutines.
		- how can you send data into a channel?
			R: `channel <- "message"`
		- how can you read data from a channel?
			R: `message := <- channel`
